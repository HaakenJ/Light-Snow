Handlebars index file will display the full page and it will have variables
listed for each value that will be rendered.  

When I call the weather API, it will fill an object with the values I want
to render onto the page.  

I will then pass this object to res.render("index", obj); which will render 
the data onto the page.

### Icons
- Icons can be found on darkskyapp.github.io/skycons

### Functions needed

    - get a timestamp from ____ hours ago relative to current.
    - Parse the JSON Dark Sky response to create an object to render
    - Take in different weather types and output certain colors/effects

### API's to Use

    - Dark Sky
    - GEOCoding API to change addresses to lat long
    - LIFX API
    - Twilio to send a text to you when you wake up displaying the weather
        properties you asked for.

# Dark Sky API

    - Icon data point will have the name for the weather forecasted.
    - Use axios to make requests directly from Node.js
        - This is because Dark Sky does not support CORS.
        - Your Node server is the proxy server between your client and 
            the Dark Sky servers.
