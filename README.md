# Project1-TBD

<p>
The purpose of our webpage is to have a light linked up to a webpage, that in returns can give a notification depending on the weather conditions of a specific mountain resort. The user has the option to change locations from our dropdown list where we have the api call to collect data for the current conditions of that location.</p>
<br>
<p>
The main use is for outdoor enthusiasts who want to know the conditions of their desired resort so they can decide on if they are going to be heading up to the mountain or not.</p>
<br>
<p>
We used several API's and different technologies for functionallity, such as:<p>
<br>
<li>Open Weather API for the conditions</li>
<li>LIFX to operate our lightbulb</li>
<li>moment.js and moment.js timezones</li>
<li>OpenCageData API to convert addresses to latitude, longitude, and a timezone.</li>
<li>anime.js</li>
<li>embedded google maps</li>
<br>
<p>Once the user selects a resort, they will be shown:</p>
<li>The local time</li>
<li>Description of the current weather</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Wind Speed</li>
<li>Wind Direction</li>
<p>There is also a map that will show the location of the resort that is selected.</p>
<br>
<p>If a user would like to add a resort they click the 'Add a resort button' then:</p>
<li>A modal shows up with inputs for a name and address.</li>
<li>The user inputs the name and address and submits.</li>
<li>The new resort data is added to their local storage so each time they visit the page
their dropdown list will include their new resort.</li>
