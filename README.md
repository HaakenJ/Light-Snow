# Project1-TBD

<p>
The purpose of our webpage is to have a light linked up to a webpage, that in returns can give a notification depending on the weather conditions of a specific mountain resort. The user has the option to change locations from our dropdown list where we have the api call to collect data for the current conditions of that location.</p>
<br>
<p>
The main use is for outdoor enthusiasts who want to know the conditions of their desired resort so they can decide on if they are going to be heading up to the mountain or not.</p>
<br>
<p>
We used several API's and different technologies for functionallity, such as:<p>
<br>
<li>Open Weather API for the conditions</li>
<li>LIFX to operate our lightbulb</li>
<li>moment.js and moment.js timezones</li>
<li>anime.js</li>
<li>embedded google maps</li>
<br>
<p>Once the user selects a resort, they will be shown:</p>
<li>The local time</li>
<li>Description of the current weather</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Wind Speed</li>
<li>Wind Direction</li>
<p>There is also a map that will show the location of the resort that is selected.</p>
